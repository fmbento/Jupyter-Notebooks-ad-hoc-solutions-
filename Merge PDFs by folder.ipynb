    "\n",
    "1.  The `os.listdir()` function is used to loop through each subfolder in the specified root directory.\n",
    "2.  For each subfolder, if it has two PDF files inside, a `PdfFileMerger` object is created.\n",
    "3.  The `os.listdir()` function is used again to loop through each PDF file in the subfolder. \n",
    "4.  We then use the `sort()` method to sort the list by filename.\n",
    "5.  The sorted list of PDF files is then looped through and added to the `PdfFileMerger` object.\n",
    "6.  The output filename is created by concatenating the subfolder name with '.pdf'.\n",
    "7.  The merged PDF is written to the output file using the `write()` method of the `PdfFileMerger` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this code requires the `PyPDF2` library, which can be installed via pip (`!pip install PyPDF2`)."
